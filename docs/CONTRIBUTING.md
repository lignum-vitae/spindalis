## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lignum-vitae/spindalis/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with it.

## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

If you find a bug or unexpected behavior, please open an issue in the GitHub
repository. When reporting a bug, provide the following information:

- A description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- Any relevant error messages.
- The version of the library you're using.

### Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, please open an issue
describing the feature and why you think it would be useful.
We encourage open discussions before starting to code a new feature.

### Pull Requests

To contribute code:

#### Note

Detailed below is the process of adding the repo as an upstream repo through your
Command Line Interface (CLI).

However, GitHub allows you to sync your fork through their Web UI by navigating
to the GitHub Page of your repo fork and clicking on the `Sync fork` button.

GitHub also has its own CLI that allows you to use the command
`gh repo sync owner/cli-fork -b BRANCH-NAME`.
You can read more about that in the
[GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
here.
If you go this route, you should be able to skip steps 4 and 9, as well as omit
`upstream/main` from step 5 below. Push your changes directly to your GitHub fork.

The GitHub desktop app also provides a UI that makes creating, deleting, and editing
branches on your fork easy.

#### 1. Open a new Issue following the above-mentioned guidelines

#### 2. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account

#### 3. Clone your fork locally:

```nginx
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spindalis.git
```

#### 4. Keep your fork up to date with the main branch

```nginx
# Add the main Spindalis repo as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lignum-vitae/spindalis.git
# Get latest changes
git fetch upstream
# Verify your remotes
git remote
```

#### 5. Create a new branch for your changes:

##### Choose ONE of the following commands

```nginx
# Creates a new branch that stays in sync with the main repository
git checkout -b feature-name upstream/main

# Checks out existing branch if you already have a branch locally
git checkout feature-name
```

#### 6. Make your changes in your local repository

#### 7. Run your changes in your local environment

```nginx
# Format your changes
cargo fmt

# Run your tests locally
cargo test

# Lint your work with Clippy
cargo clippy
```

#### 8. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

```nginx
# Gets latest changes from main Spindalis project if you've set up an upstream branch as detailed above
git fetch upstream
# We recommend individually adding each file with modifications
git add <filename>
# Commit files after all files with modifications have been added
git commit -m "Add feature: description of change"
```

#### ðŸš¨ Using "git add ." when staging changes

While `git add .` is convenient for adding all modified files, it can lead to
messy commits. Consider using it only when:

- You've reviewed all changes
- You're certain about each modification
- You've checked git status first
- Your .gitignore is properly configured

#### 9. Rebase Your Development Branch on the Latest Upstream

```nginx
# Make sure all is committed (or stashed) as necessary on this branch
git rebase -i upstream/main feature-name
```

You may need to resolve conflicts that occur when both a file on the development
trunk and one of the files in your branch have been changed.
Edit each conflicting file to resolve the differences, then continue the rebase.
Each file will need to be "added" to mark the conflict as resolved:

```nginx
# Resolve conflicts in each file, then:
git add <resolved-filename>
git rebase --continue
```

#### 10. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

```nginx
git push -f origin feature-name
```

#### 11. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main branch of the original Spindalis repository on GitHub

- You may need to click the `compare across forks` link under the `Compare changes`
header that populates when you click `New pull request` to see your local repo fork.

#### 12. In your PR description, include:

- A summary of the changes.
- Any relevant issue numbers (e.g., fixes #123).
- Information about tests and validation.

## Code Style

We follow [that Rust style guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/)
for code formatting.
Please run `cargo fmt` before committing.

Some additional notes:

- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep lines readable (Cargo defaults to 100 characters).
- Make sure to update documentation if your changes affect the usage or API.
- Rust has two forms of tests; integration tests, and unit tests. Add unit tests
in the same file as your changes for any new functionality that is self contained.
Add integration tests in the `tests/` folder for any changes that require functionality
from multiple areas within the Spindalis crate.

You can format the codebase by running this from the root:

```bash
cargo fmt
```
